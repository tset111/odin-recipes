        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I have been making this egg casserole for 13 years, primarily for Christmas brunch gatherings. It includes eggs, bread, cheese and sausage. It also works great with bacon.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 Â½ pounds ground breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>16 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
            <li>7 slices white bread, torn into pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brown sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain off grease, and set aside to cool. Pour the eggs into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, combine the sausage, bread and 12 ounces of the cheese. Mix well and pour this into the egg mixture. Top with the remaining 4 ounces of cheese and cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 15 minutes, uncover, and bake until casserole is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
